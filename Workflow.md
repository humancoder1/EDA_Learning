- Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers. Machines mimic cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving. 

- Machine learning is the study of programs that are not explicitly programmed, but instead these algorithms learn patterns from data. 

- Deep Learning is subset of Machine Learning in which Multilayered Neural Networks learn from vast amount of data.  

- In 1950, Alan Turing developed the Turing test to test a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. Alan Turing's test has served as a foundational threshold for artificial intelligence.


1.) Problem Statement - What problem are you trying to solve?
2.) Data Collection - What data do you need to solve it?
3.) Data Exploration and Preprocessing - How should the data be cleaned so model can use it?
4.) Modeling - Build a model to Solve problem
5.) Validate - Did we Solve the Problem?
6.) Decision Making and Deployment - Communicate to stakeholders or put into production.

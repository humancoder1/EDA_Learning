- Understand statistical estimation and inference
    - Statistical inference is about finding relationships between variables in a population by studying a sample of the population.

    - Statistical inference involves 3 main things:
        1. Finding associations between variables: This means looking for relationships between different variables. For example, you might want to know how a person's height is related to their parents' height and food intake.
        
        2. Determining the relationship between variables: This means figuring out whether the relationship between two variables is positive, negative, or neutral. For example, you might want to know whether there is a positive relationship between food intake and height, meaning that people who eat more tend to be taller.

        3. Understanding the nature of the relationship: This means determining whether the relationship between two variables is linear or nonlinear. A linear relationship means that there is a straight-line relationship between the two variables. A nonlinear relationship means that the relationship is more complex and cannot be represented by a straight line.
    
    - Statistical prediction, on the other hand, is about using data to predict future outcomes. For example, you might want to use data on someone's food intake and parents' height to predict their height.

- Estimation => application of algorithm eg. taking an average
- Inference => involves putting an accuray on the estimate eg. standard error of an average

##### Central Limit Theorm
- If we take the average of a bunch of a random samples , the distribution of those average value is going to be normal curve.

##### Frequentist statistics
- It is concerned with repeated observation in limit

##### Queing Theory
- The study of working with queues or lines and how many servers we need to match the size of that queue or the size of that line. 

- In the frequentist approach it is to estimate the probabilities
- In the Bayesian approach it is to estimate the probabilities of a certain number of customers coming over a fixed time period.

- Frequentist:-
    - There is a fixed value for a given probability in the population of our sample. We derive the estimate directly from the data with no external influence. 

    - Decision Boundary: This approach uses a p-value to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. A pre-defined threshold (often Î±=0.05) is set as the decision boundary. If the p-value is less than this threshold, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

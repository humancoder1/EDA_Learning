##### Hypothesis Testing
- Hypothesis is a statement about a populatuin parameter Example:-
    - such as the mean of our poison distribution
    - our estimate of the number of people that will come into the line for our grocery 

##### Types of Hypothesis:-
- The Null Hypothesis(H0)
- The Alternative Hypothesis(H1 or HA)

##### Bayesian Approch
- In Bayesian Interpretation , we don't get a decision boundary
- we'll get posterior probabilities of the null and the alternative hypothesis, and see which one is more likely.

- Posterior Probabilities: Instead of a single decision boundary, the Bayesian approach calculates the posterior probabilities of both the null and alternative hypotheses based on prior probabilities and the observed data.
- Comparison of Probabilities: The final decision isn't based on a single threshold but on comparing the posterior probabilities of the two hypotheses. The hypothesis with the higher posterior probability is considered more likely to be true.

- Key terms:

    - Null hypothesis (H0): The default hypothesis, typically stating no effect or difference.
    - Alternative hypothesis (H1): The opposing hypothesis, proposing an effect or difference.
    - Prior probabilities: Beliefs or knowledge about the hypotheses before considering data (used in Bayesian approach).
    - Posterior probabilities: Updated probabilities of the hypotheses after considering data (used in Bayesian approach).


- In simpler terms, the frequentist approach provides a binary decision (reject or fail to reject) based on a p-value threshold, while the Bayesian approach offers a more nuanced picture by presenting the probabilities of both options, allowing you to compare them directly and make a decision based on the relative likelihood of each hypothesis.
